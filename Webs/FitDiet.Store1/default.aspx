              THE SECRET TO EATING LESS. NATURALLY.

For centuries, the Japanese have held numerous secrets and traditions to promote health and longevity, with one of the most significant being the discovery and use of the ancient Japanese Konjac Root. One exclusive form of the root is used in the development of the active ingredient in Fit™ Calorie Crystals proprietary ingredient called KonjaLean mC™. <br />
<br /> 

The unique Fit™ Calorie Crystals turn into a natural “fibrous-gel” when it comes in contact with liquids in the stomach. This natural dietary fiber improves satiety, slows carbohydrate absorption and picks up and removes fat from the colon wall. Normally, calories from fat, sugars and other macronutrients are broken down in the stomach and absorbed in your body through the small intestine. When food mixed with Fit™ Calorie Crystals reaches your stomach, our micro-coating dissolves and activates the unique Fit™ fibers to form a gel that traps portions of food. This gel, along with the food it traps, is not absorbed by the body and instead passes normally and harmlessly through your digestive tract.<br /><br /> 

Effective all-natural Fit™ Calorie Crystals provide incredible benefits to anyone interested in losing weight quickly, safely and naturally. Fit™ Calorie Crystals also provide additional  benefits recognized by health conscious individuals which include the lowering of cholesterol, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and improving intestinal health and regularity. Incorporating Fit™ Calorie Crystals into your daily routine will help you to lose weight, eat less and improve your overall health!</td>
