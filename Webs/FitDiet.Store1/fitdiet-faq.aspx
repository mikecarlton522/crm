      <br />
      <span class="body_bold">What are Fit™ Calorie Crystals?</span><br />
        <span class="body">Fit™ Calorie Crystals represent a quantum breakthrough in natural weight manage- ment and healthy eating. Fit™ Calorie Crystals are a safe and effective food additive that when sprinkled on your food, effectively reduces the amount of calories your body absorbs without changing the taste, smell or nutrient content of your food!<br />
        <br />
        </span><span class="body_bold">Is there a secret ingredient in Fit™ Calorie Crystals?</span><br />
        <span class="body">Yes! Fit™ Calorie Crystals feature an amazing active ingredient called KonjaLean mC™, which is a 100% all-natural fiber from the time tested Konjac root. KonjaLean mC™ contains virtually zero calories, is an all-natural fiber and generally recognized as safe by the FDA.<br />
        <br />
        </span><span class="body_bold">How do Fit™ Calorie Crystals Work?</span><br />
        <span class="body">When food consumed with Fit™ Calorie Crystals reaches your stomach, the special micro-coating dissolves and activates the unique Fit™ fibers to form a “gel” that traps portions of food. This gel mass along with the food it “traps” is not absorbed by the body, and instead passes normally and harmlessly through your digestive tract.</span><br /><br />
      <span class="body_bold">How Do Fit™ Calorie Crystals help slow carbohydrate absorption?</span><br />
        <span class="body">Because Fit™ Calorie Crystals are such powerful carbohydrate trappers, they surround portions of food including sugars and carbohydrates, creating an all-natural fiber gel.</span><br /><br />
      <span class="body_bold">Can Fit™ Calorie Crystals help with controlling appetite and blood sugar levels?</span><br />
        <span class="body">Yes! Fit™ Calorie Crystals not only reduce a percentage of the calories that you’re eating, but it also helps you leave more calories on your plate. The unique fast acting fiber in Fit™ Calorie Crystals swell up to by nearly 200 times its own size within a matter of minutes to slowly and gently fill your stomach so you feel fuller, faster.<br />
        <br />
        </span><span class="body_bold">Do Fit ™Calorie Crystals contain any drugs or harmful substances or cause any side effects?</span><br />
        <span class="body">No. Fit™ Calorie Crystals are made from 100% natural insoluble fibers that are naturally and gently eliminated through your digestive tract without uncomfortable and embarrassing side-effects that can be associated with “fat blockers.”<br />
        <br />
        </span><span class="body_bold">What other health benefits can I expect when using Fit™ Calorie Crystals?</span><br />
        <span class="body">The active fiber component in Fit™ Calorie Crystals have been shown to reduce cholesterol, regulate blood sugar and reduce carbohydrate absorption, resulting in measurable weight loss and an increase regularity in more than 40 combined studies!</span><br />
